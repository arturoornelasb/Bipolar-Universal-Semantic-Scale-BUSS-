# Bipolar Universal Semantic Scale (BUSS) - V2 Validation

TL;DR: Empirical validation of the BUSS framework for semantic opposition using SVD on IMDB reviews; code for reproduction included.

This repository contains the code, experiments, and V2 paper for the "Empirical Validation, Operational Efficiency, and Generative Evaluation of the Bipolar Universal Semantic Scale (BUSS)".

This version replaces the original V1 preprint. The previous work contained a flawed methodology, including a tautological proof of the Perfect Opposition Theorem (POT) and efficiency claims without context.

This V2 repository rebuilds the project from scratch using an iterative and rigorous process on the 50,000-document IMDB corpus.

## Key Research Findings (V2)

Our research validated the BUSS framework in Pillars 1 and 2 and provided a definitive empirical explanation for the failure of Pillar 3. (See paper/BUSS_Paper_V2.tex for full details).

 Pillar 1: Validation of the BUSS "Map"

The objective was to prove whether BUSS (Centered SVD) creates a geometric separation of opposite concepts (1-star vs. 5-star) that is statistically superior to standard LSA.

Angular Discovery (Cosine Gap): The V3 model (100-dim) produced the best angular separation. It showed a Cosine Similarity Gap of 0.004936 over LSA, proving BUSS creates a statistically significant (p < 1e-33) angular separation.

Distance Discovery (Euclidean): The Euclidean Distance gap between BUSS and LSA was statistically insignificant (e.g., ~0.000003), proving the BUSS advantage is purely angular (a "rotation") rather than a simple "pushing apart" of vectors.

V4 Model (500-dim): While the V4 model's angular separation was smaller (Gap of 0.001708), its components were found to be critical for Pillar 2.

 Pillar 2: The BUSS "Map" is Practically Useful

The objective was to test if BUSS-derived features were better for a practical task (sentiment classification) than LSA.

Discovery: The V4 model (500-dim) is the practical winner, achieving 87.16% $\pm$ 0.33 accuracy, marginally but consistently outperforming LSA (87.15% $\pm$ 0.34).

Key Discovery: We proved (with p=0.0001) that the +1.5% accuracy gain over the 100-dim model was due entirely to the 400 extra components, and not to lemmatization (p=0.6567). This proves that the "topical noise" from Pillar 1 was, in fact, valuable predictive information for the classifier.

Validation: We qualitatively validated the strongest axis of the V4 model (Axis #4), confirming it is a pure sentiment axis ("great/love" vs. "bad/worst").

 Pillar 3: Why Generative Training Fails

The objective was to use our validated Axis #4 to train a DialoGPT-small model with a Bipolar Contrastive Loss (λ). We replicated the V1 paper's finding (the training failed) and proved why.

Discovery: The training failed at all levels of λ (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0). The BUSS Loss (sentiment) remained perfectly stable at ≈0.12 and never decreased.

The Cause: The model ignored the sentiment task. The LM Loss (learning to speak, ≈4.68) was ≈40 times larger than the BUSS Loss (≈0.12). The optimizer logically focused on the dominant loss, treating our sentiment signal as noise.

Final Verdict: The evaluation (Table 4 in the paper) confirms the trained models performed no better (and sometimes worse) than the untrained base model (e.g., Negative Adherence: 74.00% Base vs. 72.00% with λ=1.0).

## How to Reproduce the Results

This is a research project. The scripts are designed to be run in order to reproduce the chain of findings.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

NVIDIA GPU (for Pillar 3 training) with CUDA 12.1+

All Python libraries from requirements.txt

2. Environment Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/arturoornelasb/Bipolar-Universal-Semantic-Scale-BUSS-.git](https://github.com/arturoornelasb/Bipolar-Universal-Semantic-Scale-BUSS-.git)
cd Bipolar-Universal-Semantic-Scale-BUSS-


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python3 -m venv buss_env
source buss_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


(First time) The scripts will automatically download NLTK data (punkt, wordnet, stopwords) and the IMDB dataset from Hugging Face datasets.

3. Running the Experiments

The scripts must be run in order, as later steps depend on the artifacts.

Step 1: Pillar 1 Analysis (Generate all data/axes)
(This generates artifacts for both V3 and V4)

python 1_pillar_pot_validation/p1_01_build_matrix.py
python 1_pillar_pot_validation/p1_02_calculate_axes.py
python 1_pillar_pot_validation/p1_02_calculate_axes_v4.py


(Optional: Run the final analysis script which generates the gaps/p-values)

python 1_pillar_pot_validation/p1_06_euclidean_distance.py


Step 2: Pillar 2 Analysis (Find best model & axis)
(Generates the classifier and axis nomenclature)

python 2_pillar_classification/p2_03_isolate_variables.py
python 2_pillar_classification/p2_04_find_sentiment_axis.py
python 2_pillar_classification/p2_05_axis_nomenclature.py
python 3_pillar_generation/p3_02_build_classifier.py


Step 3: Pillar 3 Training (Ablation Study)
(This will train all 3 models. Runtime: Approx. 15-20 minutes per script on a GTX 1660 SUPER)

python 3_pillar_generation/p3_01_train_buss_lora.py
python 3_pillar_generation/p3_01_train_buss_lorav2.py
python 3_pillar_generation/p3_01_train_buss_lorav3.py


Step 4: Pillar 3 Final Evaluation
(Generates the final verdict table comparing all models)

python 3_pillar_generation/p3_04_evaluation_ablation.py


4. Troubleshooting

NLTK errors: If you see LookupError, run python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('stopwords')"

CUDA issues: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date and compatible with CUDA 12.1. Set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 if needed. Training on CPU is not recommended.
